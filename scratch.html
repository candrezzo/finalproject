        <li>Introduction to Pokemon</li>
        <p>
            Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a multimedia franchise that started with a series of video games created by Satoshi Tajiri and developed by Game Freak. The original concept, inspired by Tajiri's childhood interest in insect collecting, revolves around capturing and training diverse creatures called Pokémon. Each Pokémon has its unique abilities, traits, and evolutionary paths, allowing trainers to compete in battles and complete their Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia.

        <p>
            Since its debut in 1996 with the games Pokémon Red and Green in Japan (later released as Pokémon Red and Blue in other regions), the franchise has expanded into one of the most successful media franchises worldwide. It encompasses video games, a trading card game, an animated television series, movies, merchandise, and more. Pokémon continues to evolve, introducing new generations of Pokémon and games that explore new regions and technologies in a growing Pokémon universe.

            The enduring appeal of Pokémon lies in its community-driven activities, competitive play, and the deep connections fans form with the Pokémon characters. This immersive world not only encourages exploration and strategic thinking but also fosters a global community of fans sharing the joy of catching and raising Pokémon.
